        <h2>Remembering A Hero, Three Years On</h2>
        <p>Three years ago, today. The day of the Ascension. Silence, Hero of the Aelfir, stands tall, knife in hand, ready to put a stop to <a href="./cataclysm.html">the Drow's nefarious plans</a>.

Through the power of the Gods, they won, and the Aelfir succeeded in their plan to to try to birth a god, and their bravery in standing up to the drow when nobody else dared has led to their memory lasting forever.

What they stood for - knowledge above all else, taking joy in the small moments and never being afraid to speak your mind - is what the future of Spire is now built on, and the glittering iron statue of them in the plaza outside the Council building in Amaranth is proof of that. Though they may be long gone, they live on in our hearts.

            <h1>A Hearty Excursion!</h1>
            <h2>Local Detective Plans Expedition into the Heart Itself</h2>
            <p>Following what they believe to be a message from the Solar Pantheon themselves, a local detective has decided to take a break from solving crimes, and make a break for the Heart itself!

"The Gods ask a great thing of me," said Steph Sparks-Like-Lightning, the owner of the detectives' agency undergoing the task. "I don't know if it's possible, but since they has done so much for our city already, I don't think I can say no."

The Solar Basilica have refused to comment on whether they accept this message as a true manifestation of the Gods' will, or merely one detective's overactive imagination. Regardless of the truth of the matter, though, one thing's for certain - <a href="heart.html">they're going to need all the help they can get</a>!

        <h1>Aelfir Landlord Assassinated</h1>
        <h2>Found with stab wounds in his chest, and an intricate calling card beside the body.</h2>
        <p>Last night, aelfir landlord Smithen Dashed-On-The-Rocks, owner of a large housing complex in The Works, was found dead in their home.

It appears, from interviews, that the killer walked right past the elf's guards, making no attempt to hide themselves - and the guards were simply too stunned to react. One guard described the killer as "the most beautiful person I've ever seen, humming a song to themselves that felt... alien."

One month ago, another rich aelfir was also found dead in similar circumstances - and the killer had the same attributes, namely unearthly beauty, and a song on their lips that felt "wrong". "It felt as though that song was... somehow realer than everything else around me," remarked one of Smithen's guards, "and as I buried a knife in their chest, they were unfazed, other than a small hitch in the song."

Theories abound about who this mysterious killer might be - a blood-witch, perhaps, or an unknowable zoetrope horror from the depths of the Heart, or even an angel of the Goddess, given form to take revenge on the aelfir for their crimes against us. <span class="redacted">The truth, though, is a little stranger.

Matching their appearance with previous sightings, it appears that this figure may be some kind of reincarnation of the hallow Narcissus. Pictograms taken of them show their face to be almost identical to the statue in Council Square in Ivory Row. Did they fake their own death, to become a martyr? Or is this some sort of vengeful ghost? We will likely never learn the answer.</span>
