<i>An obituary by Celiza Legs-Up-High</i></h2>
<p>Vexilia, technically, isn't dead.

Her body still walks Spire, though controlled by a higher power. But the friend and confidant that I've known for decades is gone. Not to speak ill of the Gods, but... I miss her. She was a loyal friend, a champion of the underclasses, and one of the kindest masters to her drow servants that I've ever met. I hope that your soul may rest when Brother Harvest departs this world.

Vexilia. My dear friend and mentor. We will miss you.

Goodnight.

Signed, your friend, Celiza Legs-Up-High.
