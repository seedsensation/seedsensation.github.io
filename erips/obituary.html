<i>An obituary by Celiza Legs-Up-High</i></h2>
    <p>Two days ago, Vexilia Blessed-New-Dawn was assassinated, on what was supposed to be her finest hour. She <span class="redacted">can anyone hear me?</span>, and discovered her first arcology at 54 years of age, making her one of the <span class="redacted">It's cold.</span> in history. I got to have a chat with the woman herself a few years ago, and something that she told me stuck with me. "<span class="redacted">So cold. I don't know where I am. I don't know what I am. I don't know where I'm going. Oh gods somebody help me</span>." She always did have a way with words. I met with her, <a href="./cataclysm.html">on the day of her death</a>, during the gala, and she told me that <span class="redacted">out of here. the afterlife was supposed to be peaceful. it hurts. my body twists, my bones break, my tendons scream, steam courses through my veins and it burns</span>, and those words haunt me to this very day. If only she knew that she was not long for this world. If only I knew.

But that's life. As an ardent worshipper of Brother Harvest, she knew that better than anyone. I like to think that she's <span class="redacted">and burns the steel burns, presses like a searing iron against my mind presses against thousands of other minds forget me and my work, gruelling work for hours and hours and</span>. Vexilia was a dear friend to many, a genius inventor, a <span class="redacted">hours until i forget who i am. i.     i  can't remember</span>, and, of course, my mentor and <span class="redacted">who i am but i remember. i know that i am</span>

Vexilia. <span class="redacted">moving always moving and</span>.

We will miss you.

Goodnight, <span class="redacted">burning and breaking and tearing i know who i am and i know that i am</span>.

Signed, <span class="redacted">the last one. the only one left. i am</span>.</p>
