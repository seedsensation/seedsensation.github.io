        <h1>Three Years Since the Ascension</h1>
        <h2>How has our city changed?</h2>
        <img src="spire.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Three years ago today, our city changed forever. Under the guidance of Brother Harvest, working through Vexilia Blessed-New-Dawn, Spire was brought into a new age of prosperity, the likes of which we could not have imagined even weeks before.

<a href="./cataclysm.html">The specific events leading to the Ascension are widely documented</a> - and, of course, so is the impact that it had on our beloved city.

The Drow have been all but wiped clean from the City, and Brother Harvest sits upon his throne at the peak of the Solar Basilica. The only drow that remain work their durances under careful watch from the Solar Church - as, since the discovery of the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, it is known that we cannot trust them.

Finally, after years of being treated as second-class citizens in our own city, now, the future is finally, <i>finally</i> looking bright.

Friends, lovers, enemies and betrothed, may the Harvest's Heart carry you all to victory.

Thank you.

        <h1>Solar Basilica opens doors to impoverished</h1>
        <h2>by Allegra Sunrise-Over-Meadows</h2>
        <p>The ever-growing Solar Basilica today announced that they are starting a new initiative to house Amaranth's poorest.

Poverty all across Spire has been increasing steadily since the Ascension - though, of course, that doesn't need to be said. Just another scar that the Drow's treatment left on us, and one that likely won't heal for a good few decades. <a href="./future.html">The world keeps moving</a>, the balance of power shifts, and we're left to pick up the pieces.

The drow left us with nothing after the ascension - no servants, no workers, nothing. We were forced to rebuild. And, of course, the world we imagined after they departed never came to pass. Some day, we will make this place our true home again, and until then, we must all take care of each other. We must stay close to each other, remember the importance of our community, and work together to bring about the world that our forefathers once envisioned, before they took it from us.
