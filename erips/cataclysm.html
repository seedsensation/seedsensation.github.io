        <h1>Solar Church Unveil a New Sun</h1>
        <h2>What happens now?</h2>
        <p>Today, <a href="./obituary.html">Vexilia Blessed-New-Dawn</a>, on behalf of the Solar Church, unveiled their newest invention: The Sun, on Earth, in miniature. It is self-sustaining, a miraculous power source that can outlive all of us, and it is a symbol of our prosperity, beating all the odds.

Rumour has it that the plan is for Vexilia to be entombed within the Church, as part of a months-long ritual to try to draw one of the Solar Pantheon to Spire for the first time. If all goes to plan, Brother Harvest himself will walk Spire for the first time, in Vexilia's body. He will rule over Spire with an iron fist, and all will bow to his rule. I, for one, cannot wait. We've been trying to summon the Gods to Spire for centuries, and have failed for centuries. I hope that, with the new Sun-On-Earth as an anchor, the Gods will finally take notice of our city.

        <h1>The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress - Exposed</h1>
        <h2>The Secret Paramilitary Cult Behind the Destruction of Amaranth</h2>
        <p>Who are The Ministry? This question likely would not have been able to be answered - until today, when an aelfir informant told us the details.

The informant, who wished to remain nameless, met with one of our reporters inside a Vermissian station, while our reporter investigated the mysterious disappearances in the Silver Quarter, minutes before the reveal in Amaranth. The information given to us is priceless - and we will report on it here.

The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress - or simply, "The Ministry" - are a cult. One of the most insidious cults we've covered in this paper, in fact, as they have infiltrated every area of Drow society. They are intertwined in the fabric of the Cathedral of Our Glorious Lady, and their web of corruption covers everything from the Downspire Quarterly rag to nobility, like "Lord" Malrique, who was recently exposed for trying to use the Heart for his own nefarious ends.

According to our informant, five Ministry operatives - or "Ministers" - went on a top-secret mission, with the end goal being to destroy Amaranth for good. They used forbidden Prokatakos technology, creating a blast channeling the malicious power of the Moon to consume everything in its path, attempting to wipe the aelfir from Spire entirely.

"Luckily, some of us survived to tell the truth about what happened," said our informant. "One of the ministers, a drow named Narcissus, killed someone very dear to me over the course of their mission, and now they plan to destroy everything we hold dear."
