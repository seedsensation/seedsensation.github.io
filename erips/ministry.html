    <h1>The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress - Fact or Fiction?</h1>
    <h2>An open letter from a once-Magister of the Ministry</h2>
    <p>
This letter is intended for five very specific people. If you're reading this, you know who you are. Anyone else, feel free to read this letter however you want - it likely won't make much sense to you, though.

<div style="transform: scale(-1,1);text-align: right; margin-top: -20px;white-space: pre-line;">Hello. You just can't stop digging, can you? Even after all the pain it's caused?

You're so distraught at what you did that you've come all the way here, just to find a world in which you didn't act?

I told you before. There's no secret waiting to be revealed. There's no final truth buried under mountains of old newspapers.Yes, obviously, things are worse here. Vexilia's gone, through no fault of your own this time, her form given to a God to puppet. This is the world that exists if you did nothing.

And our world, lost, teetering on the edge of collapse. The drow are struggling, the city is dying. The Council isn't strong-willed enough to keep the city running. Sure, it'll even out in a few decades, but, for now, poverty runs rampant, the aelfir that still control parts of the city are worse than ever, and there's no help coming.

This is the world you created. And I think it's time you accept it.

Signed,
Lord Malrique
