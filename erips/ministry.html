    <h1>The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress - Fact or Fiction?</h1>
    <h2>We investigate the myth of the Ministry, and attempt to find out once and for all!</h2>
    <p>
        Hi. It's been a while. I see you sneaking around in the vault, looking for closure, looking for anything to make you feel better about what you did. But there's no point. There's no secret waiting to be revealed, some final truth that means you were right all along. Millions of people are dead, because of you. Carefully laid plans, laid out over generations, destroyed in a moment, becuase of what? Zealotry? Anger? I wish I could look you in the eyes right now, and tell you exactly what I think you should do, but unfortunately, <b>Narcissus</b> took care of that for me.

And now, here you are. Years later. Digging through old scraps of paper, aimlessly searching for the final piece you're missing. Here's the truth of it, though:

You failed us. Sure, you succeeded at the mission- you removed the fe from their seat of power. But that wasn't our only mission. We needed a transfer of power. We needed structures put in place so that when we finally executed our strike, a strike with singular precision and overwhelming force against the high elves, we could take over, and life would improve. And we're here right now because you failed.

Poverty runs rampant. Aelfir still rule swathes of the city, the new drow Council are useless, the Ministry has dissolved into infighting. I'm sorry that this isn't the ending you wanted, but things rarely work out as well as you expect them to. Gods, I hope that there IS some secret, something that'll finally set us free, something deep in the heart that'll put things back the way they're supposed to be.

But there isn't.

This is all we have now.

It's time to leave this place behind. Let the Ministry fade away, into stories and legends, a figment of someone's imagination. Nothing but a work of fiction - it's not needed anymore.

Feel free to waste more of your time searching through the Vault, looking for answers. Hell, if you find something in here that can fix this mess you've created, then maybe your lives will have been worth something after all. But, until then..
go to hell.

Signed,
Lord Malrique
