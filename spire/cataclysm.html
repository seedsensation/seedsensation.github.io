        <h2>Amaranth Destroyed - Who is to blame?</h2>
        <p>Earlier this afternoon, an explosion was reported deep in the Solar Basilica. It quickly spread outwards, consuming everything in its path, until it at last dissipated - leaving the Silver Quarter in ruins, and leaving no trace whatsoever of Amaranth, the Solar Basilica or New Heaven.

<span class="redacted">Some say</span> the Aelfir are to blame, <span class="redacted">while the majority of evidence points towards</span> the explosion <span class="redacted">being </span>caused by <span class="redacted">a group of Drow insurgents - the same insurgents, as it turns out, that were responsible for the assassination of</span> <a href="./obituary.html">Vexilia Blessed-New-Dawn</a>, <span class="redacted">beloved</span> inventor and devotee to the Solar Church.

The hubris <span class="redacted">of these insurgents led to the destruction</span> of the Aelfir ruling council, and <span class="redacted">the deaths of</span> millions of Aelfir across the city of Spire <span class="redacted">- and if the remaining Paladins are to be believed, there will be hell to pay for these insurgents. Believed to be part of the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, a paramilitary organisation hidden within the ranks of the Cathedral of Our Hidden Mistress, it appears that these foolish insurgents</span> have brought about their own downfall.

        <h1>The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress - Exposed</h1>
        <h2>The Secret Paramilitary Cult Behind the Destruction of Amaranth</h2>
        <p>Who are The Ministry? And what role did they have to play in the destruction of Amaranth? These questions likely would not have been able to be answered - until today, when an aelfir informant told us the details.

The informant, who wished to remain nameless, met with one of our reporters inside a Vermissian station, while our reporter investigated the mysterious disappearances in the Silver Quarter, minutes before the detonation in Amaranth. The information given to us is priceless - and we will report on it here.

The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress - or simply, "The Ministry" - are a cult. One of the most insidious cults we've covered in this paper, in fact, as they have infiltrated every area of Drow society. They are intertwined in the fabric of the Cathedral of Our Glorious Lady, and their web of corruption covers everything from the Downspire Quarterly rag to nobility, like "Lord" Malrique, who was recently exposed for trying to use the Heart for his own nefarious ends.

According to our informant, five Ministry operatives - or "Ministers" - went on a top-secret mission, with the end goal being to destroy Amaranth for good. They used forbidden Prokatakos technology, creating a blast channeling the malicious power of the Moon to consume everything in its path, attempting to wipe the aelfir from Spire entirely.

"Luckily, some of us survived to tell the truth about what happened," said our informant. "One of the ministers, a drow named Narcissus, killed someone very dear to me over the course of their mission, and now they plan to destroy everything we hold dear."
