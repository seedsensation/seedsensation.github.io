        <h1>Three Years Since the Cataclysm</h1>
        <h2>How has our city changed?</h2>
        <img src="spire.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Three years ago today, our city changed forever. In a flash, a thousand thousand lives were lost, as centuries of aelfir hubris came to a head atop the Solar Basilica.

<a href="./cataclysm.html">The specific events leading to it are unknown</a> - the only ones who knew likely perished in the blast. However, what we do know is that in the end, the very hubris that took the aelfir to the heights of power in Spire brought them to their knees.

We have spent the last 3 years rebuilding after this catastrophe. Everything from the top half of the Silver Quarter (known as "Upsilver" to residents) to New Heaven were completely disintegrated in the blast, along with the entire ruling council of the Spire.

We were left with no rulers, no governance, no help from the aelfir homeland. But, as we tend to do, we survived. The aelfir once described us as cockroaches, and we proved them right. The aelfir, or at least the worst of them, are gone, and we remain.

And now, the future is finally, <i>finally</i> looking bright.

Mesy&eacute;s and Majis, fanmi and shazin, may the Goddess' Heart carry you all to victory.

Thank you.

        <h1>Cathedral of Our Glorious Lady opens doors to impoverished</h1>
        <h2>by Allegra DeMarco</h2>
        <p>The ever-growing Cathedral of our Glorious Lady today announced that they are starting a new initiative to house Ivory Row's poorest.

Poverty all across Spire has been increasing steadily since the cataclysm - though, of course, that doesn't need to be said. Just another scar that the aelfir's despotic rule left on us, and one that likely won't heal for a good few decades. The world keeps moving, the balance of power shifts, and we're left to pick up the pieces.

The fe left us with nothing after the cataclysm. We were forced to rebuild. And, of course, the world we imagined after they departed never came to pass. Some day, we will make this place our true home again, and until then, we must all take care of each other. We must stay close to each other, remember the importance of our community, and work together to bring about the world that our forefathers once envisioned, before the fe took it from us.
