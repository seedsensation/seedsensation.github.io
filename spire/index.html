        <img src="spire.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Three years ago today, our city changed forever. In a flash, a thousand thousand lives were lost, as centuries of aelfir hubris came to a head atop the Solar Basilica.

The specific events leading to it are unknown - the only ones who knew likely perished in the blast. However, what we do know is that in the end, the very hubris that took the aelfir to the heights of power in Spire brought them to their knees.

We have spent the last 3 years rebuilding after this catastrophe. Everything from the top half of the Silver Quarter (known as "Upsilver" to residents) to New Heaven were completely disintegrated in the blast, along with the entire ruling council of the Spire.

We were left with no rulers, no governance, no help from the aelfir homeland. But, as we tend to do, we survived. The aelfir once described us as cockroaches, and we proved them right. The aelfir, or at least the worst of them, are gone, and we remain.

And now, the future is finally, <i>finally</i> looking bright.

Mesy&eacute;s and Majis, fanmi and shazin, may the Goddess' Heart carry you all to victory.

Thank you.
